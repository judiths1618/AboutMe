                        Cloud Computing provides an effective platform for executing large-scale and complex workflow applications with a pay-as-you-go model. Nevertheless, various challenges, especially its optimal scheduling for multiple conflicting objectives, are yet to be addressed properly. The existing multi-objective workflow scheduling approaches are still limited in many ways, e.g., encoding is restricted by prior experts' knowledge when handling a dynamic real-time problem, which strongly influences the performance of scheduling. In this paper, we apply a deep-Q-network model in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting to guide the scheduling of multi-workflows over infrastructure-as-a-service clouds. To optimize multi-workflow completion time and user's cost, we consider a Markov game model, which takes the number of workflow applications and heterogeneous virtual machines as state input and the maximum completion time and cost as rewards. The game model is capable of seeking for correlated equilibrium between make-span and cost criteria without prior experts' knowledge and converges to the correlated equilibrium policy in a dynamic real-time environment. To validate our proposed approach, we conduct extensive case studies based on multiple well-known scientific workflow templates and Amazon EC2 cloud. The experimental results clearly suggest that our proposed approach outperforms traditional ones, e.g., non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, multi-objective particle swarm optimization, and game-theoretic-based greedy algorithms, in terms of optimality of scheduling plans generated.

                    Distributed computing systems such as clouds continue to evolve to support various types of scientific  applications, especially scientific workflows,
                    with dependable, consistent, pervasive, and inexpensive  access to geographically-distributed computational capabilities. Scheduling multiple
                    workflows on  distributed computing systems like Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds is well recognized as a  fundamental NP-complete problem
                    that is critical to meeting various types of Quality-of-Service (QoS)  requirements. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization workflow
                    scheduling approach  based on dynamic game-theoretic model aiming at reducing workflow make-spans, reducing total cost,  and maximizing system fairness
                    in terms of workload distribution among heterogeneous cloud virtual  machines (VMs). We conduct extensive case studies as well based on various well-known
                    scientific workflow  templates and real-world third-party commercial IaaS clouds. Experimental results clearly suggest that our  proposed approach
                    outperform traditional ones by achieving lower workflow make-spans, lower cost, and better  system fairness.
